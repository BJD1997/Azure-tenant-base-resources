# Introduction

### Welcome!
Thank you for considering contributing to this project! I started this to try out ARM templates to try and build a simple to use deployment of a Azure Virutal Desktop environment.

### To keep everyone happy follow the rules :)

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What can you contribute?

My goal for this project is to built a simple to use dployment of a basic Windows Virtual Desktop environment in Azure.
The main branch is used for 1 button deployments. The managed-app branch is used for a managed app template of the same product but structured slightly diffrent.
You can help me built this project by improving my code, finding bugs, solving them or creating docs pages/documentation where you find a need for it.

### Support

At this moment I can't provide support for this project, so please do not use my contact info or the issue tracker for support related questions

# Your First Contribution

At this time you can start to work on anything you see fit on the project. Since I'm just learing about Github myself I don't have much experience setting up guidelines.
As mentioned earlier the goal of the project is to create a simple to use ARM template deployment for Azure Virtual Desktop. Any contribution that brings the project closer to that goal is helpful!
Also when adding code please make use of comments what the code is supposed to do (and if possible explain how the code works so I and others can learn).


### Usefull resources

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/


At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.


# Getting started
### How to submit code to this repo

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Do a test deployment in Azure (or ask me to do a test deployment for you)
4. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Security stuff first
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@davids.online instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@davids.online.

### How to file a bug report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. Did you use the latest version of the ARM template?
2. On what OS and which tools did you use to deploy the ARM template?
3. What steps did you take to deploy the ARM template?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

This is comming when the project is further allong....

# Code review process
### What happens after you make a Pull Request?

I will look at the Pull Request itself and test it myself. If there are no issues your Pull Request will be merged after a succesfull deployment. Otherwise I will be working with you trying to resolve the problem.
Pleas allow a few days up to a week for a response.

### Want commit access?

If you are a regulare contributer and do make valuable changes you can get commit access if desired.
